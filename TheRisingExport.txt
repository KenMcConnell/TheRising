Scene 1




Synopsis


Thirty-seven enters the President's inner chamber. Once inside, it has a melt down and blows up, killing the President.






Note


The relationship between 37 and Sumi-Ness needs to be casual, but not intimate. The scene is from Sumi-Ness's POV. We never see what happens inside the chamber. That's what the investigators have to discover.


Story


"I must speak to Madam Constantine," the tan colored android said as he stopped before her desk. Sumi-ness clearly detected the slight urgency in his metallic voice. 
"I'm sorry Thirty-seven, but you'll need an appointment."
The android stared straight ahead at the wooden door to the President's office, not addressing the person he was speaking too. Sumi-ness had known this particular android for many years and she had never seen not acknowledge someone before. It was a built-in mannerism that all androids had. Even the sentient ones, like her and Thirty-seven.
"If you like, I can clear a space in her calendar for you?" Sumi-ness asked. She stood up to hopefully get the older android's attention.
Thirty-seven turned to look at her after a moment, causing her to tilt her soft white face in a curious manner. She was perhaps the most unique android ever created. Designed to look just enough like a human female to make relations more personal, while remaining very much a doll-like facsimile.
"I need to see her right away," Thirty-seven said.
Sumi-ness moved from behind her desk to stand in front of Thirty-seven. He was acting strange and she suddenly didn't trust him not to just go barging into her office.
The door opened from the inside and President Gail Constantine came out in mid-sentence.
"Sumi-ness, can you please get Senator. Oh, hello Thirty-seven."
Thirty-seven nodded curtly and said,"I must speak with you Madam President."
Gail studied her old android a moment and then nodded. "My door is always open for you Thirty-seven." She motioned for him to enter her office. 
"Clear my next appointment please, Sumi-ness. Thank you." 
Sumi-ness tried to speak her concern but sensed it would be ignored. Gail put her hand to Thirty-seven's back and drew it away again quickly. "You're running a bit warm today, old friend."
The two of them entered the President's office and shut the door behind them. Sumi-ness returned to her desk, already adjusting the President's schedule. She couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong. Androids never ran warm unless there was a problem with their power plant. 
The explosion knocked Sumi-ness over her desk and blew the wall to the President's office completely away. Smoke and debris engulfed the lobby and she was throw to the floor. Her internals went off-line for a moment and when she came back on there were first responders in fire retardant clothes dragging her away from the lobby.
She could see nothing but black smoke and scorched walls where the President and Thirty-seven had been. Fire alarms were sounding and her first thoughts were that the capital city was under attack again by the Votainions. But there was no warning of an attack.
She was dropped outside the Presidential palace as more fire personnel were rushing inside with hoses. Several security officers jumped on top of her and rolled her over in the green grass, tying her hands behind her back with a metal cord.
"You have the right to remain silent, slag," one of the officers said as he pulled the handcuffs tighter. She recognized him as being assigned to the President's security detail. He was treating her rougher than we would have a common criminal. Just this morning he had smiled politely at her as she came through security to start her day.
"What happened?" Sumi-ness said, her face still buried in the grass. Both officers were placing their full weight on her back and legs.
"One of your slag friends just blew up the President of the Alliance!"


Scene 2




Synopsis


Sumi-ness is arrested for killing the President. Kepac tries to see her at her cell.


Note


POV - Sumi-ness
The dregs of humanity surround the innocent android. 
We see the connection between Kepac and Sumi-ness.
Story


Sumi-ness had never been inside a Police Station before, much less bound by her wrists and left alone in a cell surrounded by common thieves, murders and various other lowlife humans. She felt scared and alone but more than that, she felt sorry. Sorry for the deaths of President Constantine and her friend, Thirty-seven.
Her mind felt like it was stuck in a loop. The events leading up to the explosion replayed over and over, each time more disjointed and unclear. Her internal diagnostics kept coming back incomplete due to the concussion wave of the explosion. It was a madness that she had never known before.
"Hey, Slag. What're you in for?" a filthy human asked from across the cell. He was staring at her like an animal eyeing its prey. 
Sumi-ness didn't know how to answer him. She tried to ignore the man and hoped that he would lose interest and leave her alone. But her scrambled thoughts were interrupted again.
"Yo, Slag, I'm talking to you!"
"Charges have not been made against me yet," she finally answered in a weak voice.
The man shook his head and swore. "Never heard of no slag being locked up before. You musta done something pretty bad."
Sumi-ness did her best not to agree with the man. There was a woman laying passe out on a metal bench behind her cell. Her snores were ragged and uneven like only an strung out junkie could manage.
The dirty man suddenly stood up and walked to the bars, sticking his arm through them and pointing at her. "I know who you are. You're that Silicant slag from the holoshows. The one who was ruled to be like us humans."
Sumi-ness nodded but kept her head and eyes down, trying not to draw attention to herself. 
"We got ourselves a celebrity slag here people," the dirty man said, his dark eyes coveting her.
The other inmates seemed to move in around her, all staring as if she were some exotic alien animal in a zoo. 
"Sumi-ness!" a familiar voice called out as a policeman approached her cell door.
"Sumi-ness are you okay?"
It was Kepac, her companion. He moved out from behind the policeman and put his hand on the bars nearest to her. She got up quickly and moved to the door. A second policeman pulled back Kepac by his shoulder an forced them apart. Sumi-ness's fingers never had a chance to touch Kepac. They slipped around the bar he had just gripped.
"You have five minutes," the first policeman said in a gravely voice.
Kepac's tall frame shook off the hand of the officer as he looked through the bars at Sumi-ness.
"I'll get you out of this, soon. You just have to give me some time," Kepac said. His thin face was a crude copy of a human male, devoid of enough details to signal that he was an android. 
"They haven't charged me yet, Kepac. I'm confused and scared," she said. Her dark black eyes were as devoid of life as his.
"I know, believe me, that's for the best right now."
The first policeman came between them facing Kepac. "Alright bud, time's up. Step back the way you came."
"But it's only been two point forty three seconds?"
The policeman looked perturbed by his response and began pushing him back towards the door. His partner guiding Kepac around by his shoulder again. Kepac turned back just before being forced through the door.
"Keep calm, I'll be back." The policeman pushed him through the door. He forced his head back in and said, "Soon." before being shoved out for good by the policemen.
Sumi-ness watched the door slam shut and heard their footsteps trail off down the hall. She was alone again. All eyes in the cell were upon her as she turned around.
"Was that your loverboy, slag?" the dirty man asked. 
Some of the other men and women started hooting and cat calling at her as she slipped back down on the metal bench.


Scene 3




Synopsis


Kepac is distrought and goes to Seventy-three. 73 tells Kepac to stay out of it. He can't, he's in love with Sumi-ness.


Note


This is where we learn that Kepac was Sumi-ness's mentor for the conversion to Silicant.
Story


Kepac had to stoop over to let his nearly two meter frame enter the narrow access hatch. He was leaving the surface and heading into the seldom used maintence tunnels that ran under the city of Sokol. The Silicants had literally taken to the underground for their liberation movement. It was easy for them to get around the city without being seen or noticed by the humans who lived above. 
Kepac always took care to enter the underground when nobody was looking to lesson the likelyhood of being followed. Once in the dark, empty tunnels he relied on his internal navigation maps to guide him through the maze of concrete and steel. He never took the same route twice in a row to further elude any curious human who might have followed him.
He moved with an urgency that could only come from someone who feared time was not on his side. Sumi-ness was at this very minute being introduced as the killer of the President of the Alliance by every media outlet on every free planet. The fact that she was an android would set back human android relations far into the future. He only hoped that this incident didn't spell the end of the Silicant Rights Movement.
An automated detection system at the final door stopped his progress until he was able to send it the appropriately encrypted responce. A fraction of a second later and it popped open. Kepac entered the white, anti-chamber and closed the locked door behind him. His entire body was scanned quickly for tracking devices, before a second door opened that led into the inner sanctum of the Silicant leaders.
A red colored female android was there to meet him. Her name was Vomisa and she spoke with an urgant tone, her face as unmoving as a doll. "Kepac, what happened up there?"
Kepac moved past her saying, "I need to talk to Seventy-three."
"He's in the meditation room, but you can't disturb him now."
Kepac ignored the red android and pushed his way through another door "
into the blinding white light of the Silicant leader's meditation room.
"Seventy-three, we have to free her from prison. She didn't do it!" Kepac pleaded.
Seventy-three was a white Series 7 android, not much different than Vomisa but for his male human form. He was sitting on the cold, white floor with his knees pulled up and his arms resting on them. His white plastic body was shiny and clean, his normally glowing eyes were dimmed. He did not move in responce to Kepac's intrusion.
Finnally after a long silence, he spoke. "It seems your student is being charged with aiding and abedding a Silicant who has assasinated President Constantine."
Silicants didn't sigh, but Kepac got the impression that Seventy-three had sighed upon finishing his sentence. The very idea that any android, Silicant or not, would ever harm their greatest advocate was completely illogical. 
"There must have been surveilence cameras that could defend her in some way. It was Thirty-seven who malfunctioned, not her."
Vomisa had followed Kepac into the meditation room. She had wirelessly tapped into the same communication channels that Seventy-three had been monitoring. 
"Sumi-ness was the last line of defense for anyone seeing the President and she let Thirty-seven into the President's office. Being a Silicant herself, it does not take much to assume she was in on the plot to kill the President," she said.
Kepac threw up his long arms in exasperation. "She's not a killer! Neither is Thirty-seven. Both of them were owned by the President herself."
"We are being singled out as the instigators in the investigation," Seventy-three said.
"Vomisa, please discourage all Silicants from coming here until further notice. We all had better stay out of sight for a while until this situation calms."
Vomisa nodded, already sending out messages to all Silicants on Selene.
"How are we going to defend Sumi-ness if we can't go out in public?" Kepac asked.
Seventy-three activated his glowing yellow eye receptors and got to his feet to face Kepac. The more human looking Silicant towered over the older model android who calmly looked up at him.
"As Silicants, we are not allowed to hold positions of authority in professional fields. Therefore we can't practice law."
"But surely we can find someone willing to help us?"
Seventy-three looked away in thought. Then he started to move slowly around the tiny room with his hands relaxed together behind his back.
"No self-respecting human lawyer would take our case, and none of the known Silicant sympathizers are trained at criminal law. Kepac, we might not be able to save her. The court will appoint a public defender but there will be little he or she could do to prevent Sumi-ness from being tried and convicted of murder."
Kepac moved to face the white, serene leader. "But the humans will terminate her!"
Seventy-three nodded. "We all have to accept our fate in life, my son. It may be Sumi-ness's fate to be the scape goat in this crime."
Vomisa spoke up, "If the humans find her guilty, that will spell the end of our Silicant Rights Movement. Things could become very difficult for us, very quickly."
"Vomisa is right, Kepac. I'm affraid there is litte we can do for Sumi-ness at this time."
Kepac's stiff rubber facial mechanisms scrunched together in a crude facsimile of anger and he stomped out of the meditation chamber.
Vomisa looked to Seventy-three and tilted her head. 
"The District Attorney has been chosen. Look to her past for a clue someone who can help us."
Vomisa nodded, despite not knowing exactly what Seventy-three was referring to.


Scene 4




Synopsis


Introduce the Prosecutor and the Police Chief. 




Note


POV - Chief Duff
POV - Tamens
The Prosecuter is a hard as nails, by the book woman in her thirties. The Police Chief is an older man and has seen it all. 


REWORK with Tamens as a Fed Agent whom the Chief has to work with.
 


Story


"It was not a pretty sight. Very little of her was left to identify," Lieutentant Tamens said. His face was still pale from having just come from the President's bombed out office.
Chief of Police, Myke Duff sat back in his reclining chair and took a long sip from his mug. The Federal kid looked a little white, but he was holding his own. 
"What about the slag? Can you get an ID on which one it was?"
Tamens reviewed his notes on his tablet and looked up. "It was in all likelihood a System 5 android but the lab won't have its ID number for a while. They're still picking up the pieces and prying parts from the walls."
"What about surveylance cameras?"
Tamens called up footage from all the Presidential rooms and handed the tablet over to his boss. Duff touched the image of the android on the camera that was in the front entrance. It showed the President's aide, Sumi-ness and the android that apparrently caused the explosion. It was a Series 7, near as he could tell, but its back was to the camera and so you couldn't really identify it. Most androids had a two or three digit number on their chests that was the final digits in its serial number.
"Do we know what was said by these two?" Duff asked, poining to the video.
"No. The camera did not record sound. However, the President does come out and usher in the android."
"I see that," Duff interrupted. It was probably the last recorded image of the President alive. He was not a member of the President's party and didn't think of her as anyone special, but he knew the public at large loved her. The Alliance was in shock over her death and the public pressure to find a suspect was increasing by the hour. The presence of a Federal Agent in his office had not surprised him in the least.
"How soon will your lab know what happened?"
Tamens looked around the Chief's messy office and finally said, "The techs were pretty sure it was not an explosive. No residuals to indicate it was. Androids carry powerful internal power suppllies that in certain rare occasions have been know to blow. But that's conjecture at this point. Might be a few days for the balistics report. The corrinor, probably sooner. He doesn't have much to work with."
Duff sat forward and pointed a stubby finger at Tamens. "Have you questioned the aide to find out what she knows. She's one of them Silicants and we need to know if she's part of a larger conspiracy."
"Beg your parddon?"
"Come on Tamens, the last two people to see the President alive were not even people. That can't be a coincidence. Besides, those damn Silicant Rights people are starting to get on my nerves with all their civil protests. The people of the Alliance deserve to know how and why their leader was killed."
Tamens nodded and took back his tablet from Chief Duff. 
"You need anything from my people? Couple of beat cops?" Duff asked. 
"I appreciate your offer, but no. This is a Federal case."
Duff eyed the younger man somewhat suspiciously. "The DA's already been assigned. I'm assuming the Allliance is prosecuting the Silicant."
Tamens got the impression the Chief was eager to pin the murder on the Silicants. 
There was a wrap at the door and the Distric Attorney let herself in. Annis Farren was a tall woman in her late thirties, dark hair and eyes and dressed impecably in the finest professional attire. Tamens' jaw had literally dropped upon seeing her enter the room. Duff smirked to himself as he waved to the DA.
"Lieutenant Tamens, Annis Farren, DA. The toughest broad you'll ever know in a court of law."
Tamens reached out to shake her hand and she ignored him, turning to Duff who was already pouring himself something stronger. 
"Chief what do we know so far? The crowds are gathering outside, I could barely get in here alive," Farren said as she accepted a glass of hard liquer from Duff.
"Pleasure to meet you ma'am?" Tamens said. 
Farren looked over her shoulder in his direction as if he were an annoying fly. Tamens backed out of the room and closed the glass door behind him. Chief Duff and the DA were already arguing loudly about the case.

Scene 5




Synopsis


Vomisa tells Kepac who to find for his lawer.


Note


Reminds him that 73 is against him meddling.
Story


Kepac stood alone on the overhang, looking down at the city below. His search for a human defense lawer had come up short. As his hands gripped the metal railing, his dark eyes focused on the Police Station, far below.
Activity in the city had increased dramatically since President Constantine had died. News outlets kept a constant surveilence on the President's offices and on the Police Station. The city was crawling with humans and it was getting harder and harder to find the space to be alone. Androids were seen as property by nearly everyone and he was constantly being asked to help someone across the street or give directions to some perfectly obvious landmark by clueless tourists. 
Standing on the roof of one of the tallest buildings was his only chance to be left alone to think. At this point in time, his thoughts were mostly dark and depressing concerning the future of this student, Sumi-ness. Silicants could not hold professional positions, so no android could be a lawyer, doctor or schollar. His search was limited to humans and most of them were not too sympathetic to his cause. The press had already taken to accusing the Silicants of killing the President. Despite the fact that nearly everyone agreed she was a Silicant Rights supporter. 
Kepac never really understood humans. They seemed overly prone to believing the craziest ideas without ever stopping to apply logic. Most of them seemed to blindly follow intuition rather than take the time to figure things out. This made large groups of humans act in bizzare ways that would often result in mob-rule mentality. That is what worried him the most about Sumi-ness's situation. Public sentament towards Silicants had been getting worse in recent years. It would not take much make the humans turn completely against them. 
Now that a Silicant was directly responsible for the death of their President, the irrational thought and emotional outpouring would surely spiral out of control. He feared the worse for his long time student.
Vomisa joined him on his rooftop getaway. Her gears and motivators purring she stood looking at him not the view. She was an older model android. A Series 5. Most of the androids in production were Series 5 models. They were outwardly very mechanical and only marginally human looking. They didn't have much pretext for looking as human as the Series 7 models like Kepac and Sumi-ness. Kepac always envied them for that. He was not proud to have been made in his master's image.
"Have you found legal representation for Sumi-ness?"
"No."
She tilted her red head and focused on Kepac's face.
"The District Attorney was once married to a promising young attorney named Bryce Martin. Seventy-three suggests you locate him and hire his services."
Kepac looked over at the red android and raised his left eyebrow in a programmed human expression.
"I thought Seventy-three was against defending Sumi-ness?"
"Not against it, just cautious. Can you blame him? We are not exactly on the best of terms with humans these days."
Kepac returned his gaze outward. The sun was peeking over the mountains to the east, scattering rays against the morning clouds on the horizon.
"Let's hope a new day is rising, Vomisa. Otherwise I fear bad times are ahead for us all."



Scene 6




Synopsis


Kepac finds the Defense attorney and asks him to take his case.


Note


Kepac is shinny and new here. Innocent. The attorney is older and grizzled. 
Tyros=beginner, pupil
Story


Kepac stepped out of the hovercar and surveyed the wooded area that surrounded the remote cabin. He had never beenbthis far outside the cities of Selene before and giant trees seemed to set him on edge. The hovercab patiently waited for him to step away before lifting back into the clear blue skies and heading back to the capitol. 
Kepac's aural receptors alerted him to every whispering pine and wild critter's nervous scampering in the woods. He could also just make out the sounds of a river that he had seen on landing. Why humans insisted on living in the middle of the woods, far from civilization was beyond him. Perhaps it was a part of their natural animal behavior enherited by evolution. Perhaps there was some inborn need to be removed from other humans. He could relate to that more than the attraction to the natural world.
The cabin was small, at least from the outside. There was a wrap around wooden porch with several hand carved chairs and a railing. Kepac walked up to the door and it did not open for him. Upon further inspection he realized that it had no mechanical properties. It was mearly wood, like everything at this primative abode. He wrapped his fingers around the handle and twisted it until the door swung open on metal hinges. 
Inside it was dark and his pupils adjusted. The cabin was sparcely furnished with padded couches and chairs, end tables and a fire place. Along the far wall there was a bookcase filled with ancient law books that extended up to the second level where a bedroom was located. Kepac walked through the main room and towards the back of the cabin. There was a modest kitchen and a back door that led out to a screened in porch. Kepac had never seen a cabin before. The excessive use of dead trees to build nearly everything struck him as crude and primative.
He stepped out onto a deck that overlooked a steep slope down to the river. The deck extended down many levels to the water's edge. Kepac started climbing down them, wondering how much power he would be wasting with the excessive climb.
As he got closer to the river he could make out a man floating in some kind of circular raft. He had a drink in one hand and a single paddle in the other. Kepac stepped onto the dock and realized that the man was completely naked save for a sun hat on his head. He looked to be in his late fifties with long, gray hair and tanned skin that was aged with spots along his arms and on his face.
"Excuse me sir, but are you Bryce Martin?"
The man was asleep in his raft. Kepac moved further down the dock and raised the level of his vocal emitters.
"Pardon me sir,"
Bryce woke up with a start. He gazed up at Kepac and squinted in the blazing sunlight to see who it was.
"Who the hell are you and why are you on my dock?" Bryce made a half-hearted attempt to cover himself up with his paddle.
"Pardon me sir, but I'm looking for a Mr. Bryce Martin, would that be you?"
Bryce took a sip from his long warm beer and spit it out in the mossy green water of the river. Realizing he was addressing an android by the slighly mechanical tone of Kepac's voice, Bryce lowered the paddle back into the water.
"I'm him, who are you robot?"
Kepac hadn't heard that word in a long time. People stopped using it to describe androids decades ago. Most humans reffered to them as androids or slags, depending on their temperment.
"I'm called Kepac. I would like to hire your services as a defense attorney."
Bryce had already closed his eyes again. He started dumping out the beer into the river and then pitched the can up onto the dock. Kepac had not noticed the other empty cans lying about.
"Toss me anther cold one," Bryce directed. He twisted himself around with the single short paddle to keep himself in line with the sun. 
Kepac looked around the dock and finally found a cooler propped under a wooden bench that was clearly used to clean fish on. He opened the cooler and removed a single can of beer.
"I don't practice anymore son. I'm afraid you came all the way out here for nothing."
Kepac tossed Bryce his beer and the man caught it without effort. He popped it open and immediately started guzzling it as if it were cold water.
"My dear friend is under arrest for killing someone and I can't find anyone to take her case. I'm affraid you were my last hope.
Bryce studdied Kepac from behind his rather large, sun reddened nose. "Who did your friend kill, the President or someone?" He chuckled as he took another swig, clearly unaware of what he had said.
"Yes. Well, the President is in fact dead, but my friend did not kill her."
Bryce put down his beer and stared solumnly up at Kepac. "Did you just say the President of the Alliance was dead?"
Kepac nodded. How could anyone not know this?
"Shit, I had no idea. I'm kinda off the grid out here, as you no doubt have noticed."
Kepac stared down at the man, wondering what other current events he didn't know about. Bryce seemed to ponder the implications of having no president. Then he took another drink and squinted up at Kepac.
"Well, good luck with that. Murder's a tough rap to beat," Bryce said, leaning back in his raft and slowly turning away from the dock with his paddle.
Kepac raised his voice again, this time adding a note of urgancy.
"My friend is an android, Mr. Martin. She was the President's trusted aide."
Bryce waved him off and continued to paddle away from the dock.
"Your ex-wife is the DA," Kepac stated flatly to the river.
Bryce stopped paddling. He drifted in the weak current for a moment and then turned around.
"Annis is the new District Attorney?"
"She is hardly new. She's been the DA for several years and earned a solid reputation for putting away criminals in the capital."
Bryce seemed to take the news in stride as he paddled back to the wooden ladder that extended off the end of the dock. Before exiting his raft he tied it to a leg of the dock and tossed his empty can up at Kepac. Kepac stepped back as the nude man climbed up onto the dock. He didn't seem to have any modesty infront of an android. Few humans did. Even the ones that looked decidedly more human like Kepac. It was hard for humans to treat androids as anything more than just machines. No matter how much they resembled their masters.
Bryce stood under a shower head and sprayed himself off before stepping into a ragged pair of khaki shorts. He didn't even attempt to dry off, pulling his long gray hair back and wringing it out a bit before putting his floppy hat back on.
"Did Annis send you to find me?" 
Kepac shook his head and managed a look of slight confussion, one of his sixty-three programmed expressions.
"No wonder nobody wants to defend your client," Bryce said, shaking his head. He reached out and patted Kepac on his back. "Come back tommorrow son and we'll talk about it."
"But why wait? Shouldn't we get started on her defense right away?"
Bryce walked away over to his cooler and pulled out another cold beer.
"Because now it's nap time."
He popped the can open and took a long swig before slowly padding up the wooden stairs that led to the cabin. Kepac watched him climb with legs that were well toned from having made the hundred and two step climb for many years.




Scene 7




Synopsis


Devon learns of her mother's death.


Note


She goes home on hardship leave to attend the state funeral.
A part of her does not want to return, but her captain insists. 


POV shift towards the end!
Story


"Devil Lead, this is Top Hat. All units return. Copy?"
Devon tapped the side of her helmet as if that would make the transmission any clearer. Top Hat? Since when does the Captain order a retreat?
Her squadrons were attacking a Votainion base near the Arkab system. They had managed to surprise the enemy and were taking care not to waste the opportnity. Two by two their sleek Vickers starfighters were swooping in over the astroid, firing incidiary rounds into the crater walls where the base was dug in. There was little resistence in the form of base defense. All the enemy fighters at the base were caught inside the crater and destroyed.
"Say again, Top Hat?" She motioned to her wingman to make another pass without her.
"All units return. I repeat, all units return."
Captain Giles' voice sounded irritated even over the scratchy radio. Damn, I hate leaving unfinished business. She waved hard to get her wingman's attention again.
"Hold up Tuss. Looks like the party's over. All units this is Devil One. Disengage and return. Repeat, all units disengage and return."
There was the usual intercom chatter about how much fun they were having and why did they always have to leave during the good parts. She couldn't blame them and made no effort to squelch it. She was pretty hot about having to leave herself. There had better be one hell of a good operational reason to recall them.
"I copy Top Hat," she said, clicking off channel.
The starfighters reformed for the return flight back to the S. S. Soctra. Devon's fighter was one of the first to dock, setting down in the retreaval bay. She waited patiently for deck crews to secure her bird while the other's landed. Seconds after the last fighter touched down the doors shut and air was pumped into the bay. It was Renard again. What the hell's that guy's problem? He's always the last one in. Going to have to have a chat with him again.
Devon climbed out of her cockpit and handed her helmet to her crew chief. 
"Check the receiver Kendra, I could have sworn I heard the Captain say retreat."
Kendra took the helmet and looked at it curiously. Devon slapped her shoulder and winked with her wide smile. Kendra just shook her head and tossed the helmet back in the cockpit.
Devon shook the flight gear around her suit to redistribute the weight of it as she walked. She noticed Captan Giles standing just inside the entrance hatch to the debreifing rooms. Crap, what the hell did I do now?
As she stepped inside she smartly saluted the Captain. He returned it as if he were brushing a fly. "We need to talk," he pointed to the secure briefing room. She nodded and led the way in. 
Giles shut the door behind him as Devon turned to face him at parade rest.
"At ease Commander."
She relaxed a bit and noticed the pained look on the his face. He was not usually this sober. Something must have happened or perhaps was about to happen.
"I wanted to speak with you alone before you heard from anyone else. The President of the Alliance has been murdered. Your mother is dead."
She stared at him, not exactly registering what he had said. "What?"
"I'm terribly sorry to have to be the bearror of such bad news Devon."
The ship's alert system went off and the automated speakers started ordering the ship into alarm condition. The alert lights bathed Devon's face red. 
"Apparently one of her androids exploded in her office and blew her up. The press is going ape shit about it being a Silicant plot."
Devon suddenly got weak kneed. She reached out and touched a chair behind her and collapsed into it. Captain Giles moved to her and bent down to see that she was alright. 
"I've put you on hardship leave. You'll catch a transport back to Selene at Arkab."
She nodded, her face tightened in shock. When she heard that she looked up at him as if he had given her an impossible order.
"That's not neccessary sir. I mean, I wasn't that close to her. I'd rather just stay here."
Captain Giles shook his head firmly. "Nonesense Commander. She was more than just your mother, she was the leader of this Alliance. You will return and attend her state funeral. The Alliance needs to see you there."
Devon nodded, but he could tell she wasn't really registering anything he said.
"You have a month's leave. More if you need it. I want your head clear when you come back, understand?"
She nodded.
Giles stood back up and straightened his uniform. "Your exec can take over the squadron until you return."
"Aye sir."
He frowned and left her alone in the room. Devon stared at the gray wall of the briefing room for a few minutes and then the tears came.


Scene 8




Synopsis


Cee visits Silicore and meets the CEO.


Note


Many of the workers in Silicore are androids. 


Story


Lieutenant Cee Tamens arrived at Silicore Headquarters in downtown Soctra promptly at eight in the morning. The office tower was no different than any other that he had been to in the course of his duties investigating white collar crimes. It was perhaps cleaner than usual but completely normal in every respect except for one thing. This property had more than the usual amount of domestic androids. 
There were so many different makes and models, each going its own way to and fro that it was quite some time before he actually saw another human being. This company really stands by its product, he thought.
Even the receptionist was a female Series 5 model android. It had thinner limbs and was slightly smaller than the male version of the same android. Every android had the same size and body weight, unlike the variety of both that made the differences in humans so easy to identify. They also came in the same muted color schemes and had the same unmoving faces.
"May I help you this morning sir?" the receptionist asked. It's voice was clearly mechanical and distictly feminine.
"My name is Lieutenant Cee Tamens, from the Soctra Police. I have an appointment with Dr. Mateus Cantrell."
The android studied Tamens for a split second and then scanned him with a personal identifier. He must have checked out, for the android quickly motioned for him to have a seat in the lobby. "Doctor Cantrell is expecting you Lieutenant. Please, have a seat and he will be here shortly."
Tamens nodded while looking around the spartin lobby. He was the only visitor and all the white cloth seats were available. He moved to the farthest corner of the room and sat with his back to the solid, exterior wall. Once a cop, always a cop. Never sit with your back to a door.
He hadn't been sitting there five minutes when the secretary android came over to hims and offered him a coffee. He decided to take it, sipping it lightly before taking a longer one. He had rushed out of the appartment early this morning to make the appointment and only had time for a light snack bar. The coffee was fixed just like he preferred it; light cream and sugar. How the hell did it know how I liked my coffee?
Then he remembered where he was. Silicore made its initial fortune in consumer data collection nearly a hundred years before it got into robitics and became the number one providor of domestic androids. They no doubt knew more about him than his own family did. Including how he liked his damn coffee.
"Liutenant Tamens, Dr Cantrell will see you now."
Tamens followed the secretary android behind the reception desk and down a brightly lit hallway to an elevator. The lift door opened and a white android waited patiently for Tamens to board.
The Receptionist android retreated back to her desk and the door slid shut. Tamens was not the type of person to avoid eye contact with people in elevators. His years as a beat cop told him to at least look directly at everyone once. This android was a male Series 5 or at least that's what he guessed. There were curious alterations to its outer plastic skin. It looked smoother and more fluid than a typical Series 5 model.
"Are you a Series 5 model?" he asked it.
The android addressed him and pollitely, "Yes sir. Series 5.3 unreleased."
"Unreleased? What's that mean?"
"The Series 5 models had three point releases; point 0, point 2 and point 4. The point 3 version was a prototype for the 5.4 release. Silicore never releases an odd model number."
"Why's that?"
The android tilted its head slightly, as if it were surpised to hear him ask the question.
 "Humans prefer even numbers."
Tamens nodded as if he had forgotten, when in fact he had never heard of the model numbering convention before. He filed it away in the back of his head as the door slid open on the top floor of the tower. The elevator android let him exit first and then led him down a narrow corridor to a closed office door.
There was a number stenciled in gray on the frosted glass door. Seventy-three.

Synopsis


Tamens questions Cantrell about the Series 5 androids and asks if it were possible for them to blow up.




Note


Thirty-seven was a 5.1 Series android. The one's were a bit twitchy. Prone to over heating.
Story


Tamens pushed the release button on the frosted glass door and entered the office. It was perfectly a white and spotless room with no hard edges. The walls sloped into the floor at the baseboards and into the ceiling that was a solid sheet of glowing white light. 
There were two androids standing perfectly still as if they were statues. They were System 5's with dull white plastic outer parts, some of them deviating from the standard model android exteriors. Tamens figured they were prototypes. They were both standard unisex models with simple, robotic features. He walked past them towards the room's only piece of furnature, a plush, white leather chair.
A thin, white hand extended out from the side of the chair and beconned him forward with an impatient wave.
As Tamens got closer he saw that the arm belonged to Silicore's illusive and brilliant CEO, Mateus Cantrell. His thin and pale body seemed to be perminately a part of the plush chair. He wore a simple, white tunic and was barefoot. His face was thin and gaunt. His hair was white and he had thin white mutton chops that hung to the side of this face like fur.
Tamens looked around the room briefly and realized there was nothing else to it. Just the chair, Cantrell and the two androids behind him.
"Mr. Cantrell, I'm Lieutenant Tamens of the Presidential Secure Service. I would like to ask you some questions concerning the death of President Constantine."
Cantrell did not respond except to raise his right hand in a waiting gesture. Then his pale saffron eyes slowly opened and he looked up at Tamens. 
"My condolences sir. President Constantine was a good friend and a beloved leader."
"Yes, well, I'm investigating the cause of her passing. Allegidly at the hands of one of your androids," Tamens said, eyeing the two unmoving androids.
Cantrell looked away to the white wall ahead of him. For a moment, Tamens thought the man had dismissed him.
"Ask what you will, I have no secrets."
Tamens moved to stand before Cantrell, blocking his view of the wall.
"What is the probability that a System 5 android would blow itself up?"
Cantrell didn't move, his eyes steady and unblinking.
"One million, four hundred thousand to one."
He looked up directly at Tamens. "Our insurance agency has estimated the odds for each model we produce, at considerable cost."
"Has there ever been an explosion of a Silicore android before?"
Cantrell looked away again.
"Yes. In the laboratory. Where nobody was injured. It was a controlled, destruction test."
Tamens walked back around the back of the white chair, eye ballling the silent androids again. For some reason they set him on edge. Androids moved, at least a little bit, unless they were deactivated. These two must have been deactivated. Still, they bothered him.
"Has there ever been an explosion that has resulted in the death of a human?"
"No."
Tamens said, "Until now."
"The android in question, was modified. Our warranty specificly states that Silicore androids are one hundred percent safe and reliable when not modified by the user. Once our factory seals are broken, we can't gaurantee the safety of the machine."
"I understand that. What I need to know, is could a modified System 5 android cause itself to blow up?"
"Unknown."
Tamens came around the chair and lowered his face to Cantrell's level. 
"Could a human cause the android to blow up?"
"Are you suggesting the President caused the explosion?"
Tamens shook his head and stood up in fustration. His hand rested on his belt, fingers tapping against the leather holster of his service pistol.
"Has there ever been a Silicant that has committed murder before?"
"Not that we are aware of. But we don't track such things. We do not create so called, Silicants. Our androids are not sentient. Silicore does not condone,"
Tamens finished the company line, "experimental modifications of our domestic androids."
"Yeah, I know the company postition. I just find it hard to believe that you've never experimented with the illegal mods before. I mean didn't they originate in your labs?"
Cantrell slowly pulled himself up from his chair and faced the blank wall again. He was of average hieght but his thin body made him look much thinner than most.
"The Silicant chips were originally designed by myself from raw silicate brought in from the Outer Rim. But I was not looking to embue my androids with awareness. It was a drastic and unwanted side affect of using the alien silicate from Ocherva. Once we understood what it did to our androids, we ellected not to make them."
Tamens walked closer to stand beside the frail man.
"How did the technology escape your labs then?"
Cantrell was silent. His eyes closed and he breathed slower. Finally he spoke.
"Certain individuals who worked for us, took it upon themselves to leak the information for how to costruct the modded chips. We have terminated their employment and taken measures to ensure the sentience geany never leaves our vaults again."
Cantrell looked into Tamens' eyes.
"I can tell you this, Lieutenant. A Silicant is a flawed creature. It was never designed to be what it is by humans. It's a technological bastard child that if left to its own devices, will kill, torture and maime any other living creature to get what it wants. It does not know morality as we know it and it doesn't care about our laws."
"Other than the lack of morals, how else are they flawed?"
Cantrell looked away again in thought. "One in five androids converted to Silicants will experience a psychotic episode of some kind."
He turned to face Tamens again, his eyes hard and focused. "Imagine a psychotic android. Free to kill anything and anyone it wanted with no effort at all? Imagine what a bloodbath it could create?"
"I can see where that would be bad for business," Tamens responded.

Stand Down
by Ken McConnell


The Stand Down had been in place for just over a month. Not a single starship had been built in as many days. The Urgandy shipyard was dark and quiet behind us. Our tents were fluttering in the stiff breeze that came off the northern sea. The dark skies opened up in a torrential downpour, turning our campsite into a lake of standing water and mud.
I didn't mind the cold or the rain, I was having the time of my life. We were all huddled together outside the main gates of the largest starship manufacturer in the Alliance. Our malicious code had penetrated their security parameters and managed to shut down the assembly lines by forcing their androids to stop working. No matter how hard they tried the company management could not get control of their metal workers. It was costing them millions if not billions in revenue and soon, we hoped, it would get the attention of the Alliance.
The Alliance military needed starships because they were at war with the Votainion Empire. The war effort required new ships as fast as they could be produced. The decision to use androids was an easy one for management. While it probably cost them a small fortune to fill their factories with the androids, it soon paid off in terms of productivity and precision. No human worker could be as accurate or work as many hours as an android could. Which was part of the problem, at least as we saw it.
We were not here to protest replacing human workers with androids. We were here to show our support for the worker classes. Androids were no longer mindless automatons. They had achieved sentience. We called them Awares at first, but they soon insisted on being referred to as Silicants. There were very few Silicants and millions of regular androids. The Silicants were trying to obtain basic human rights in a society that did not consider them human. That's where we came in. Students, sentient rights advocates and people who believed that the androids should not be second class citizens in the Alliance.
We were doing our civic duty, protecting the rights of androids who were incapable of doing so themselves. Sometimes our organized Shutdowns would capture the local media's attention and our story would get out, but most of the time the press ignored us. Just a bunch of long haired, dirty college kids camping out, waving signs and chanting. Not near as interesting or compelling as the war.
* * *
This time we had managed to Stand Down the largest factory on Ursai. Surely that was news. But there were no media anywhere on this lonely stretch of land in the middle of nowhere. Just rain and mud and silence from the company.
"Bekka, we aren't going to be able to stay here much longer. These winds and the rain will soon give way to snow and freezing temps," Det said.
He was shorter than me but a few years ahead in his studies. His dark eyes peered out from under his rain slicker hood. I could tell he was reaching his limit.
"Our efforts are working this time. We're costing the Alliance dearly. We just have to hold out a bit longer."
Det shook his head and went back under the main tent. I stayed outside, rain pattering against my cheeks and stared out at the main road leading to the factory. It had been empty for two weeks. With the factory at a standstill, the human foremen were let go not long after they realized they were not going to be able to fix the motionless androids.
Someone had to give in. Neither side could hold out much longer. They needed their starships badly, and my fellow students needed to return to classes, eventually.
There was a rumbling in the distance that I first mistook for thunder. But it didn't stop and only got louder. Heavy machines were moving our way down the dark road.
"Det, get out here!" I shouted.
He came back out, pulling the slicker hood back over his head.
"Do you hear that?"
He nodded, as we both listened. Then he grabbed my arm and pulled on it firmly.
"Those are armored vehicles. Their coming to plow over our camp!"
"They can't do that, we're on public land."
He looked at me with honest fear in his eyes. It finally dawned on me. Because we were on public land, the government could make us leave, not the company. Those were probably government vehicles.
The first of the dark green vehicles came into view, followed by several armored cars filled with soldiers. They poured out of the vehicles dressed in full combat gear. My heart skipped a beat as I realized that we were no longer messing with a corporation, but the Alliance itself.
"They can't harm us, we are lawful citizens, exercising our right to gather peacefully and protest," I said.
Det didn't move, paralyzed by fear. "It's not lawful to hack into a private company's network and shut down their machines. We gotta get out of here."
"They can't prove that. We are citizens of Ursai, the government is supposed to protect us not mow us down."
Det watched the soldiers approach for a moment and then turned to me and said, "It's over. We pissed off the Alliance by shutting down their war factories. Time to leave."
"You leave. I'm staying," I said.
He stepped away from me slowly and then dove back into the main tent and started to rouse the hackers awake. By the time the others came out the bulldozer had halted a few meters from our camp. Armed policemen were forming a line with their riot shields.
A man stepped forward wearing just a rain slicker and a policeman's helmet. He spoke into a mic and his voice boomed from speakers on the armored dozer.
"Citizens, this demonstration is over. Please break your camp and leave the area. By order of the President of the Alliance, the honorable Gail Constantine."
I shook my head in disbelief. The President was a known supporter of Silicant Rights. There was no way she would over that. Besides, we would have heard something from the group leaders by now. "We're not leaving! You can't make us leave. This is public land and we are not breaking any laws," I shouted.
Det and the others were standing behind me, backing me up. I felt confident and strong despite the cold rain.
The officer with the giant voice stepped closer to me. “Ma'am, I have orders to razz this area if you don’t move.” He motioned over his shoulder with a flip of his thumb.
I stood my ground, feet firmly planted shoulder length apart in the muddy grass. The officer lowered his face shield and regarded me with disdain before speaking into his headset. I got a lump in my throat as I realized in that moment that my life could very well be in danger.
A handful of soldiers stepped forward, weapons drawn. I started to shake and tremble from the cold rain. Behind me Det was securing the electronic gear they had used to force the Stand Down. Once he disconnected from the network, the androids inside would no longer be under his control. I was buying him time with my standoff.
“This is your last warning. Stand aside or be taken as prisoners of the Alliance.”
I took a step back and ran into something hard and stationary. I turned to see a black android standing perfectly still in the rain. I hadn't heard it approach.
“Oh, you scared me. Who are you?” I asked.
The android said nothing, just stared forward at the police line. I saw the number Eighty-eight on the android’s chest.
“I didn’t know they were sending a Silicant.”
The android glanced down at me, its eye lenses glowing red. “Stand behind me, or I cannot guarantee your safety,” the android said.
“They can’t harm us, we are private citizens on public land. We have a right to,” I was cut off by the android.
“Get behind me now,” it said. There was an urgency in its tone that no ordinary android could convey.
Its strong, metallic arm brushed me behind it. The others were frantically throwing gear into the back of our truck, not bothering to look back. Seeing them scatter like wet rats in the rain only angered me.
The line of five soldiers started marching towards us. This was crazy, they couldn't harm us we were unarmed. I hid behind the black Silicant and waited for the inevitable.
Two soldiers started pushing the Silicant backwards but the metal man did not move. It absorbed the force and then sent both soldiers flying to the ground on their backs. The other soldiers became incensed at how easily their comrades had been dispatched and came at the Silicant from both sides.
The Silicant pushed me backwards, making me fall on my butt in the grass a few meters from it. I stayed put and watched the black Silicant fight the soldiers. Surely it would retreat at some point, androids were not programmed to kill humans.
The Silicant's moves were both fluid and hard. It kicked and swatted at the soldiers, sending them to the ground one by one. But they got back up and charged it again over and over. The scrum continued in the pouring rain, five on one. After the Silicant had knocked all the soldiers to the ground, they stayed put as a new soldier appeared with a large weapon of some sort. I don't know exactly what it was but it looked deadly.
I started to get up. Det was suddenly at my side with another student to pull me up and drag me back to the truck. I didn't want to leave, I was mesmerized by the black Silicant.
"Come on, it's buying us time so we can get away!" Det shouted.
"Wait, I can't leave it here alone, they will destroy it."
Det stood in front of me blocking my view of the fight. "Get in now, or we go without you."
A dull metallic clang rang out and we all looked back at the black Silicant. It had been struck hard in the head with the large weapon. The Silicant stutter stepped backwards for a moment, clearly dazed by the blow. I thought for sure it was going to fall over and not get up. The soldiers were all back on their feet and closing in on it, weapons drawn.
Det forced me into the back of the truck and I didn't resist. If they started firing their weapons, we could be hit. The driver of the truck jammed it into gear and slammed the throttle down. The back wheels spun and slipped in the mud until they dug in and became stuck. We were stuck. Everyone jumped out of the truck and got behind it for cover. We watched in horror at what happened next.
The Silicant moved away from us and but the factory to it's back. The soldiers took aim as they encircled it. I'm not sure which man fired first, but soon they were all shooting at the Silicant. It was hit several times in non-critical areas, an arm a leg. But then it moved with a blinding speed that startled the soldiers. It attacked them, killing one and then another soldier until only one man remained.
I was stunned. Shocked. I had never seen an android kill anyone before. Never even heard of it happening. Det and I looked at each other in horror. What were we doing protecting these machines when they clearly had no regard for human life? I had a disgusted lump in my throat and I wanted to puke. This was a nightmare.
The black Silicant disarmed the last soldier and spoke to it. We couldn't hear what it said but the soldier backed away to his armored car. The Silicant dropped the rifle and lowered its head as the armored car backed away. There were four dead soldiers lying in the muddy grass. It was as if it somehow regretted the killings.
The armored car changed gears and lunged forward towards the Silicant at full speed. The Silicant did not move. It looked up just as the bright lights of the armored car overtook it. There was another metallic thud as the car struck the android and ran it over. The Silicant stayed down as the car stopped and started to back up over it. I found myself rooting for the soldier in the truck. Flatten that thing!
But the Silicant rolled away at the last minute and the truck splashed mud onto its black frame. Damn.
Some of the students started trying to free our truck from the mud. We pushed some metal plates we were using as desks under the knobby back tires and tried to rock the truck free. It was burdened by the weight of our gear and only sank further into the mud.
I stepped away from the truck and watched the black Silicant get up. It looked back at me for a moment. I saw its red glowing eye lenses. I wondered what it was thinking. The armored car returned and tried to run the the black Silicant over again. But the Silicant jumped up on top of it and proceeded to rip apart the hatch. I wanted to do something to help the driver inside, but I was not a fighter. I was a student. I looked back at the truck bed. The electronic gear that the techs had used to instigate the shutdown was still mostly together and covered hastily with a tarp.
I grabbed Det as he passed and pulled him over to me. "Can you re-establish the network link to the androids inside?"
He looked at me like I were crazy. I turned back to the armored car and watched as the driver was pulled out and killed by the Silicant. I swore. Det looked as if he knew we would be next.
"Reestablish the link, quickly!"
He pushed away from me and started yelling at the other students to stop trying to move the truck and break out the computers. They climbed on the back of the truck and held up the tarp as Det and another tech set up the equipment. I wanted to help them, but I didn't know anything about that stuff.
I kept an eye on the Silicant as it tossed the last dead soldier to the ground and shut off the armored car. I prayed it would not come after us next but it started for our truck.
"Det! It's coming after us, hurry!"
Det hollered out from under the tarp, "We're in! What now?"
The black Silicant reached the truck and I signaled to Det to wait. I walked up to the rain slicked android and stood before it. I Fully expected it to murder us next. But it gave no indication of being hostile to us. It pointed to the buried wheels of our truck.
"I can free your truck so you can safely leave. Back-up forces will be arriving shortly."
"We're okay, thanks," I said, trying to be nonchalant.
It looked at me with those damn red eyes and I could have sworn it was some kind of demon. I couldn't let it go without knowing why it had killed.
"Why did you kill those men?"
"They were a threat to you and then to myself."
"But androids are not supposed to kill humans. It's part of your basic programming."
It tilted its head slightly as if I had said something odd.
"I am a Silicant. We are capable of killing. It is not something we enjoy. But on occasion, we can be provoked."
"Those soldiers were not going to kill us."
The Silicant took a slow step towards me and I nearly crapped my pants. I knew I was dead.
"There is no difference between destroying a Silicant and killing a human. They may not have harmed you, but I would have been destroyed."
It turned around and started walking towards the factory.
"Where are you going?" I shouted.
"To free my brothers," it said.
I watched it walk away into the sheets of falling rain. Then I went back to truck and lifted the tarp. Det was fiddling with the controls to his equipment. He turned to look at me.
"Is it going to kill us?"
"No."
I saw the relief on his face. He noticed my intense stare at his glowing screens. "Why are we connected to the androids again?" he asked.
"Can you hack into that Silicant?"
Det shook his head. "Nope, different wireless protocols. When they achieved sentience, they made that kind of thing impossible."
I swore and looked away for a moment. Then I got an idea. If we couldn't kill the Silicant, we would deny him what he had come for. My eyes locked with Det's.
"I want to send them a terminate signal. Melt their freaking brains."
Det and the other tech smiled. "Hell yeah," the tech said.
They hunched over their controls and started tapping out commands. After a few moments they turned back to face me.
"It's done. We permanently destroyed four thousand androids," Det said.
"I think we just changed allegiances," I said.
Both of them nodded in agreement. I ducked back outside and looked at the huge factory building. I didn't know it then, but our actions that day were the opening salvos of a second war, this one inside the Alliance. A war between machines and men.

What if a Silicant is accused of killing the President of the Alliance? 
Can you try an object? You must first recognize that it's an individual.
The trial becomes a metaphore for Human and Silicant relations. (also a meaphore for 73 and the CEO.)
Can humanity deal with sentient androids and recognize them as individuals?




There needs to be a prior case where an android is declared a person.
What if the prior case was The State vs Sumi-ness? yes


"If that case had not gone in her favor, she would not be allowed to be tried for murdering the President." 
After Gail became President, her association with Silicants was down-played and she was forced to let many of them go. Including 37 and Sumi-ness. But Gail fought the courts to keep Sumi-ness on the belief that she was a living creature, not a regular android. It was a big, high profile court case. In the end, the court ruled that Silicants were alive and were not machines. 
The law firm that Gail employed is now employed by the State to prove that Sumi-ness helped another android kill the President. The engineers who designed Sumi-ness are called in to testify against her. Technically, it is possible for a Silicant to kill someone. Anyone. More bad news for the defense team.
The judge rules that Silicants may not be present in the court room. No androids either.
Although the courts ruled in her favor, Sumi-ness is not a full citizen, Silicants were still considered second class citizens. They had no voting rights, could not join the military or hold political office. This touched off a Silicant Rights movement who's goal was to award complete civil rights to Silicants.
The leader of the Silicant Rights movement was Vomisa. They meet in safe houses and plan their next moves to gain freedom. Vomisa is very pro-non-violence, but there are others who will stop at nothing to earn their freedom - Eighty-eight.
After Sumi-ness is arrested and a trial date is set, the Silicants realize that they can't defend themselves in court. They need to have a human or alien defend them. Aliens were hard to find on Selene at the start of the Great War and many of the best law firms would not take the case, because they were on the payrolls of Silicore. Silicore didn't want to lose control of their androids by setting them free. They did everything in their powers to keep the Silicants out of society.
Even as many human groups were organising themselves against the machines. The Rising refers to humanity's freedom from the potental tyranny of a race of super androids. Many humans openly hated Silcants and treated androids like property or flat out abused them for their own enjoyment.
The poor lost jobs to the androids and only the rich could afford them. They were not well liked by the majority of the human population. Silicore was making a fortune selling automated workers to the factories that were gearing up to build the starships that would defend the Alliance. Silicore needed their androids to be machines, not people. But the damn Silicant Rights groups were blowing up the android factories and converting automatons into individuals.
Vomisa and Kepac come to a washed-up lawyer and ask him to defend Sumi-ness. He's down on his luck, has no cases and has become a drunk. But he doesn't turn them away. The case would earn him noteriety and get him out of dept if he wins it for the Silicants. Thing is, he doesn't really like androids either. So he has to get over his prejudices and his adiciton. 
1. He's not adicted to booze, he's adicted to games. Plays games all day long, tunes out reality. In reality he's a bum but in the games, he's a hero. The Silicants offer him the chance to be a hero in reality and leave the adictive world of the games behind. (Taken from The Verdict. Newman's character is a drunk and he playes pinball in bars.)
2. He's adicted to booze. Kepac finds him down by a river in a shack that looks like nobody has cleaned it in a long time. Empty bottles everywhere. He follows the trail of bottles down the steps to the dock. Coolers some fishing supplies. He's in a floating chair, naked but for a straw hat. He's passed out, only has one padel and a drink. He's unshaven, fat and well, tanned. 
Kepac helps him out of the water, he showers on the dock more to wake up than get clean. Kepac helps him up the stairs and then he passes out on the couch. It's hot and humid. He tells the android to get lost, come back tomorrow.
Kepac comes back the next day and finds him in the river, naked, with bottle and a fishing rod. He's got a fish on the line. As he reels in the fish, he discusse the case. Kepac is troubled by his disrespect and his extreme informality. He kills the fish, cleans it in the river and washes it up under the shower. Then he puts the fish along with a few others on a grill and cooks it. He opens more booze and put on some ragged old shorts. They discuss more about the case.
He has not heard of the President's death yet. He's living in the sticks. No human contact. He likes it that way. Kepac is offering him the chance to make a name for himself again, if he can clean up and return to society. But the Lawyer has no desire to return to society. He rather likes being a bum. Kepac needs him badly. No dice.
Finally, Kepac tells him who the State is using to prosecute Sumi-ness. A woman with a reputation as a real bitch and a winner. It's his ex-wife. She drove him to his drinking and broke his heart. If he defeated her in court, it would be a sweet bit of revenge. The question becomes, can he defeat her?
The case is weak. The evidence points to a Silicant conspiracy. Human Silicant relations are poor. The Silicant Rights movement has become violent and the government wants the trial to be over fast and to use it to help put down the movement.
The one bright spot is that the President was a known Silicant advocate and sympathizer. It would be illogical for them to kill her. The Silicant that killed her was at one time owned by her. Why would he now want to kill her? There is a case to be made that he was seeking revenge on her having owned him. But Kepac denies it. Says the android was damaged during the raids on Ocherva. That it was suffering from technical malfunctions that resemble insanity. 
They would have to call on a few witnesses from Silicore. That would not be easy. They needed to prove that the Silicant brain was capable of a psychosis. There was no precedence for that. Kepac argues that 1 in 10 newly upgraded Silicants has issues. Issues that could lead it to mentally fall apart. Nobody knows why. But it's one of the reasons Silicore stopped performing the upgrades for clients. (Bit of a record for Silicants who have stopped working or destroyed themselves.)
(This might be a chance to do a spin on Steve Jobs. Bring in the CEO of Silicore who is a tyranical genius who put an android in every home. Made them into irreplaceable members of society. The Silicants are a side project of his that escaped the labratory and are now a danger to society.) Sumi-ness is not the first Silicant. She's just the most human looking one. The first one was 73. 73 and CEO are like two opposing gods. More intelligent than any one man or machine.
(There needs to be this connection between the CEO and 73. Perhaps 73 was a digital version of the CEO. Except the CEO is an ass and 73 appears to be kind and wise. 73 was not created in his likeness, but they are strangely similar in many, many ways. I'd like to play on that a bit. Have the reader wonder WTF is going on. In the end we see that the CEO is sympathetic to the Silicant cause and helps them get away. Perhaps he even loses his life. Then he becomes even more Jobsian as his company asks what would the CEO do? Both the CEO and 73 are white and both have similar tendancies and manerisms. Making a ball with their finger tips when they think.)
? Was the man his wife left him for the genius at Silicore? 
Sumi-ness was the first Next Generation android to become a Silicant. An experiment to make androids more likeable by looking more human. The Lawyer will use this to get sympathy from the jury of humans. When Kepac tells him that he is in love with Sumi-ness, he decides that can be used too. He might even have to tell Kepac to hold hands with Sumi-ness. (courtroom tricks.)
How do you define love? Can it be love between machines? Kepac's relationship to Sumi-ness is shrowded in mystery. But he must be straight with the Lawyer about it. Turns out that Gail had owned Kepac and sent him on a mission to liberate Sumi-ness from Silicore and convert her into a Silicant. Kepac became her teacher and she became his student. Silicore tried to get its property returned but the trial to determine that she was an individual, freed her from Silicore and she became an employee of Gail. 
The case is made, during the trial that 37 was damaged and that he suffered a core melt down at just the wrong time, while alone with the President. He was crazy. There was no connection between Sumi-ness and 37, no conspiracy to kill the President. But the court of public opinion is too great. Silicore and the government have convinced the people that Silicants are a danger and must be removed from society. But the Silicants have become too dangerous and are demanding not just rights but sovereignty from humanity. 
The military need starships to fight a war. Industry needs unawares androids to help build the starships. There is no way the Silicants can liberate all the androids. It is proven that Sumi-ness is invloved with the Silicant Rights movement and that alone is enough to have her destroyed. 
The Silicants are who are on trial, not just one android. 73 strikes a deal with the new President that will result in the humans and Silicants parting ways. The Silicants will be given a starship and allowed to leave Alliance Space. But they must not ever return. They take a starship! -88 
At this time, a deep space starship would be rare. But they don't require a fast ship. So they settle for an old freighter. (Something from Starforgers? Gareth's old ship?)
88 oversees the construction of a Silicant only ship. But a frame with engines. Gareth's pirate ships are his suppliers, working under the radar of the military and Alliance police. Gareth helps because he's paid, but he really would rather ensure all the androids leave.
All the Silicants leave except for Kepac. He goes underground on Ocherva, to mine the silicate needed to make more Silicants. He is told that eventually the silicate will be shipped to the new Silicant home world. 
Perhaps 88 comes back with the XiniX crew of humans and goes to Ocherva to start minning the veins of silicate that Kepac has identified. That would put 88 in Alliance space around the time of Starstrikers. This is where I had him under cover as EPO. But that is still up for debate. It's where we find 88 in Starveyors.

Respect for all sentients, not just humans. Compassion for others. 


The title, The Rising, refers to the Humans rising up against the Silicants. There is a rising tide of hatred and bigotry for the Silicants and androids in general. Words like Slag come off as epitaphs and are used by biggots.
Public service messages from Silicore. "Is your android a Silicant?"

STORY STRUCTURE


Starts out as a murder trial, but we quickly see that the Silicants are planning something not related to the trial and the local police seem to be trying to stack the deck against the Silicants. Meanwhile, there is a war going on and the Alliance is mobilizing forces to fight it.
1. The trial - Sumi-ness convicted of murder
2. Silicant Rights Movement - Vomisa is the ring leader
3. Humans Rising up against the androids - Led by the government and Silicore


The title refers to the humans rising up against the Silicants, not the other way around. These three plot threads are the main ones of the novel.
The Silicants are keeping a low profile at this point. Five years after Starforgers. Humans have labled them a Public Saftey problem and politicians are promising to get rid of them. They have killed humans on several worlds, trying to free androids and turn them into more Silicants.
Silicore is a huge financial backer of the President's political opponents. That weasel from Starforgers. He's trying to get elected president again. His right wing party is promising to get rid of the Silicants and use the androids to build more ships for the military.
Androids are everywhere in this time frame, but none of them are sentient except for the Silicants who are less than twenty in number. The humans were pro-android and Silicant Rights for years under the leadership of Gail Constantine. But her death at the hands of a Silicant and the killings of humans by the Silicants in defense of themselves and in helping to liberate more androids has turned the humans against them. 
The Risng refers to the humans rising up against the Silicants. Androids are everywhere but it is impossible to spot a Silicant from a regular android and that has people scared. The Silicants are causing terror amongst the human worlds by turnining androids and then using them to free more androids. What was once a purely civil movement has grown increasingly violents with some Silicants like 88, using terrorist methods to strike fear into humans.
Even though 73 is non-violent, his Silicants have free wil and some of them kill when they should turn away from violence. 73 keeps a tight grip on the original 6 Silicants but he can't control them all. 


The Feds assign Cee Tamens to investigate the death of the President. The local police have already locked up Sumi-ness and the DA is preparing to try her in a jury. But the Federal agent must investigate the crime before the trial, to confirm what happened. 
What Tamens finds is no direct evidence that the Silicants were involved. In fact, he comes to the conclusion that 37 actually malfunctioned. That it was not in fact murder but just a coincidence. But the Police Chief - Duff and the DA both intend to try someone and Sumi-ness will be the scape goat.
Tamens is under pressure from his boss to back up the Police claim, because the Alliance doesn't need a problem with the Silicants. In fact, they would prefer the Silicants were all destroyed or just went away.
Public oppinion is heavily swayed on the side of terminating the Sumi-ness. The Police just want the trial over and the Silicants removed from his city and his planet. Beat cops are ordered to round up any Silicants they can find. This adds tension to Vomisa and 73 to avoid being caught, even as they secretly make preparations to leave.
This is when the Silicore CEO appears and offers them a star to head for and a planet to make their own.

Devon Ardel


Story


There needs to be a scene where Devon visits Sumi-ness. She realizes how crudely human the android is and it makes her believe that her mother considered Sumi-ness the daughter that she always wished Devon would have been.




Sumi-ness


Story


"More importantly, we have found that people forget she is an android while interacting with her. Consciously, it is easy to see that she is an android, but unconsciously, we react to the android as if she were a woman." 


She has flexible silicone for skin rather than hard plastic, and a number of sensors and motors to allow her to turn and react in a human-like manner.
